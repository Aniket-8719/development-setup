# Development Setup CLI

A simple CLI tool to quickly set up frontend and backend project structures in Visual Studio Code. This tool helps developers set up **React + TailwindCSS**, **React + Bootstrap**, and a **Node.js backend** with Express in a few simple steps.

## Features

- **Frontend Setup**:
  - React + TailwindCSS
  - React + Bootstrap
- **Backend Setup**:
  - Node.js with Express

## Installation

To install the Development Setup CLI globally, run the following command:

```bash
npm install -g development-setup


If you want to use it without global installation, you can use npx to run it:

```bash
npx development-setup
## Usage
Once installed (or using npx), you can run the CLI tool to start setting up your projects.

npx development-setup
# Enter project name: my-awesome-project
# Choose Frontend or Backend: Frontend
# Choose a frontend framework: React + TailwindCSS
After completion, a fully set-up project will be created in the specified directory with all required dependencies and configurations.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed before using the CLI:

 - Node.js (>=14.0.0)
 - npm (>=6.0.0)
 - Visual Studio Code (recommended for better development experience)
